# Module 4 Challenge - Marnie Brannon
---------------------------------------------------------------
This is an exercise assigned to the class to demonstrate our understanding of the concepts covered in Module 4 of AI Bootcamp.

## Motivation:
My motivation in this working on this challenge is to practice and solidify several coding concepts and Python commands, syntax, usage and best practices. The exercise needed to use the following subjects discussed in class:  librariies, data analisys, data visualization and data manipulation. I worked on this with other students in the class to help all of us share our questions, observations and ideas with one another as we learn collaboratively. 

## The focus of this exercise:
This project provides a simple interst calculator and revised (or predicted) balance for savings and CD Accounts.
The following are some of the potential problems it solves:

    ‚Ä¢	provide quick calculations for bank employees an customers
    
    ‚Ä¢	allowing customers to see how interest accumulates for them
    
    ‚Ä¢	streamlining of the new account or investment process
  

## What did you learn?
In completing this exercise I learned the following:
    ‚Ä¢ how to create a function

    ‚Ä¢ how to import and use functions
    
    ‚Ä¢ passing arguments and variables into functions
    
    ‚Ä¢ classes and class methods

## What did you struggle with?
I struggled with importing functions at first but Omar helped me by recognizing a naming error that prevented my code from working.  Once that was cleared up, i was able to continue fairly well.  
I also had a problem with the program getting stuck on line 27 where I accidentally left off a comma. I did eventually find that by Chat GPT after much frustration.
Tutor Lebuso Philly helped me corrct the format of the return and streamline a few clunky bits of code I'd made.

## Usage
 This is to be used as the customizable module which is the bulk of a larger app which will be downloaded to user's smart phones via QR code.  This code can be displayed by the food truck on their signage, ads and webpage to enable customers to view their manu and order autonomously.

With many thanks to them for time spent, Farzana and Omar provided the following help: 

    ‚Ä¢ understanding the nuances of the assignment 

    ‚Ä¢ helping one another recognize proper use use the new concepts we are leaning 

    ‚Ä¢ spotting and correcting errors

## Websites and other Sorces:

###Websites:

During the work on this this assignment, my colaborators and I used the following websites for reminders of the syntax and structure of certain commands and clarificatrion regarding the specifics of their use:

  ‚Ä¢ Chat GPT  --   www.chatgpt.com
  
  ‚Ä¢ GeeksforGeeks  --  www.geeksforgeeks.com

  ‚Ä¢ Python Principles  --  www.pythonprinciples.com

  ‚Ä¢ Stack Overflow  --  www.stackoverflow.com
  
### Books:  
I also referred to the following books for reminders, symtax rules and guidence regarding Python commands:

    ‚Ä¢ ‚ÄúThe Python Workshop, 2nd ed‚Äù (Packt, 2022) Bird, Han, Jiminez, Lee and Wade
    
    ‚Ä¢ "Python Crash Course, 2nd Edition" (no starch press, 2019) Mathes
    
    
### Applications and Extensions:

The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to https://choosealicense.com/.
________________________________________
üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.
Badges
 
Badges aren't necessary, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by shields.io. You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.
Features
If your project has a lot of features, list them here.
How to Contribute
If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The Contributor Covenant is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.
Tests
Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.provides predictive results using inputed interest rates
